Few Projects using SQL database for Data analysis

## SQL INTRODUCTION
## ACID Properties of RDBMS
Any single operation done in SQL database is called transaction. 
- Atomicity: Any transaction is completely executed or not at all
- Consistency: Data in database remains in consistent state before and after transaction
- Isolation: Each transaction is isolated from other
- Durability: Modifications made by transaction should persist in database even after system failure
